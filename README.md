# Bachelors-FinalYearProject
Final Year Project Title: "Format Checking of FYP Reports (Word files)". 
This repository contains source code of my bachelors final year project and also Report of it. 
This repository is only created to demonstrate source code for admission in masters in Germany.

Working:
Purpose of this final year project is to streamline the evaluation process for the National University of Modern Languages (NUML). 
This is done by developing a web application that automatically verifies all necessary criteria in student’s final year project reports, such as heading’s size and font, logos, chapter and paragraph headings, sub-headings, referrences, tables & diagrams, minimum word counts in specific paragraphs, table of contents and figures etc. 
I’ve also introduced SMTP services in my project, so if anything is missing from the FYP report, the student receives an automatic email which contains error highlighted word file and validation log file (which states every single validation error in a text file) . 
So Now Teachers no longer need to assess each report manually my application will go through the initial phase of checking requirements and format of provided content in FYP reports. It is created using .NET development and validates all required fields by going through each word from the Word file.

As, I'm in my last semester only minor changes are being implemented here and there after every while so FINALIZED AND SIGNED (from FYP commettee) report will be available in JUNE 2023.
